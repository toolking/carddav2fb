# CardDAV contacts import for AVM FRITZ!Box

Purpose of the software is the (automatic) uploading of contact data from CardDAV servers as a phone book into an AVM Fritz!Box.

This is an extendeded version of https://github.com/andig/carddav2fb which is an entirely simplified version of https://github.com/jens-maus/carddav2fb with much more features and stability.

## Features

  * download from any number of CardDAV servers
  * selection (include/exclude) by categories or groups (e.g. iCloud)
  * upload of contact pictures to display them on the FRITZ!Fon (handling see below)
  * transfer of quick dial and vanity numbers (see wiki for handling details)
  * if more than nine phone numbers are included, the contact will be divided into a corresponding number of phonebook entries (any existing email addresses are assigned to the first set [there is no quantity limit!])
  * phone numbers are sorted by type. The order of the conversion values ('phoneTypes') determines the order in the phone book entry
  * the contact's UID of the CardDAV server is added to the phonebook entry (not visible in the FRITZ! Box GUI)
  * automatically preserves QuickDial and Vanity attributes of phone numbers
    set in FRITZ!Box Web GUI. Works without config. (Hint: If you used the
    old way of configuring your CardDav server with X-FB-QUICKDIAL /X-FB-VANITY, then your old config is respected and this new automatic feature is skipped).
  * generates an image with keypad and designated quickdial numbers, which can be uploaded to designated handhelds (see details below)

  Additonal with this version (fork):
  * specify with `forcedupload` whether the phone book should be overwritten, or if phone numbers that are not included in the upload are to be saved as vcf by e-mail (see wiki for handling details). Last but not least: whether a download from the CardDAV server should be made if there are no new changes or not.
  * specify with `fritzadr` if fax numbers should be extracted from the phonebook and stored as FRITZ!Fax (fax4box) adressbook (FritzAdr.dbf)
